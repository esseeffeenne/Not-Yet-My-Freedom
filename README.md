# Not-Yet-My-Freedom

Simple Arch-based bash script to check how libre your packages are, according to a public blacklist maintained by the Parabola project, found [here](https://git.parabola.nu/blacklist.git/plain/blacklist.txt), which aims to remove every non-free package bundled in the Arch project.

Note: The [Parabola project](https://www.parabola.nu/) does not seem to have gained [much traction](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parabola/comments/1e84dg0/is_this_distro_just_dead/) and as such I do not recommend, on purely practical grounds, taking too seriously the output of this script. It is also rather strict in its labeling of non-free software, though I do not have problems with it. Still, I found interesting to learn just how much of my software is really **truly** free.

P.S.: the blacklist is highly opinionated.
